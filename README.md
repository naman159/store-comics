# store-comics
A python program to store the comics that I have read in a text file. A simple project that eases comic tracking for me (hmu for anything manga/manhua/manhwa). BTW this tool can be used for other puproses as well (anime, shows, etc.)

Features:
1. Add comics to your list. 
2. Delete comics from your list.
3. Track the number of chapter you have a read for a specific comic by using the find command.
4. List all the stored comics.


Run it on your PC:
1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the cloned file
3. Run python store-comics.py
4. Your comic list handler is ready!
