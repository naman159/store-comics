# store-comics
A python program to store the comic I have read in a text file. A simple project that eases comic tracking for me (hmu for anything manga/manhua/manhwa). BTW this tool can be used for other puproses as well (anime, shows, accounts?, etc.)
My PLAN: Run the code on terminal and quicly manga my comic list (its huge).
